#### By _Forrest Reiland_

## Description 

_This webpage is for a pizza parlor's online menu. It allows the user to select a pizza size as well as any combination of toppings. The user submits their selections using a submit button, and a price is returned to them. The JavaScript file uses objects to hold a key-value of size and price as well as toppings and price. A constructor is used to create each specific combination of size and toppings submitted by the user. A prototype method is applied to calculate the final price. The webpage is an exercise in using constructors and prototypes in JavaScript._
